## Notes for previous releases ##

### Installing the old ST 0.9.1 on a recent Firefox (v. >= 29) ###

Due to changes in latest firefox UI (addon bar has been removed from FF), the pencil for annotations is not visible anymore. However, you can easily patch it for 0.9.1 by installing this further extension in Firefox
