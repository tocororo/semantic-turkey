version 1.0
date: 13-09-2017
After eleven years from its first beta release, the first official stable version of Semantic Turkey is
out there!
There are way too many changes with respect to the original version. 
The most important changes are reported here:
  * Semantic Turkey is no more available as a Firefox extension. It is a service-oriented platform for 
    knowledge acquisition management, oriented to Semantic Web standards.
  * ST now supports collaborative editing of OWL ontologies, SKOS thesauri and RDF datasets in general, thanks
    to a new elaborated user model, supporting authentication and featuring a complex role&capability-based 
    model for checking user authorization on invoking any of the services published by the system
  * a new UI is available as a separate project: VocBench 3 (http://vocbench.uniroma2.it).
  * vocabularies such as SKOSXL are no more considered possible dataset models. There is a new concept of
    lexicalization model. RDFS (with rdfs:label), SKOS (with skos labels) and SKOSXL (with skosxl reified
    labels) are all possible lexicalization models. 
  * this version is not backward compatible: the data folder, though having something in common with the one
    of the previous versions, has simply underwent too many changes 
  * there is support for history and validation, natively in RDF. History supports the storage of performed 
    actions, together with their metadata. Validation allows to introduce a staging phase for the data
    modifications, before they are confirmed by users authorized to perform validation
  * the required Java version is now >= 8
  * the working graph of a project is now named after the base URI. Previously, it was the null-context
  * upgraded Karaf to version 4.0.4
  * RDF4J is the official API of Semantic Turkey (OWLART middle layer has been dropped)
  * upgraded CODA to version 1.3
  * introduced support for metadata vocabularies (DCAT, DCAT-AP, ADMS, VoID, LIME)
    * this included integration of the lime-api (http://art.uniroma2.it/lime/)

  * introduced an alignment validation module
  * added the possibility to define class axioms through Manchester expressions
  * changed the templates for SKOS entities inside the resource view
  * allowed to force the format on load data
  * upgrade to CODA-1.2
  * improved language tags handling

version 0.11
date: 04-05-2015
  * implemented the Resource View, a new resource editor
  * enabled the concept tree view in no-scheme mode
  * improvements in resource refactoring
  * implemented an Integrity Constraint Validator tool
  
version 0.10.1
date 20-11-2014

   inferred defaultgraph (e.g. OWLIM/GraphDB)

version 0.10
date: 22-09-2014
  * first time ST on Maven
  * move to Karaf container and improved OSGi management
  * ST can be downloaded at runtime inside a fresh karaf container as an additional feature through Maven
  * the server base url has been changed. Also, all services requests URLs (including those for extensions) now are modeled 
    according to the following pattern: http://<domain>:<port>/semanticturkey/<groupId>/<artifactId>/<ClassName>/<methodName>
  * enabled management of concurrently open projects (http://semanticturkey.uniroma2.it/documentation/dev/project_management.jsf)
  * generalized all services to deal with different read/write graphs (through rgraphs, wgraph request parameters)
  * introduced a "context of the request" (currently hosting project and graph parameters)
  * improved Spring exploitation (still smoothly migrated from old services)
  * updated SPARQL panel to SPARQL 1.1 (both query and update)
  * added some Integrity Constraint Validators (ICV) for SKOS/SKOS-XL thesauri
  * enabled export of SPARQL results
  * implemented a version check at client initialization
  * quickened the prefix/namespace mapping procedure at each project initialization
  * other minor bugfixes

version 0.9.1
date: 01-07-2013
  * performance improvements of some property methods
  * UI improvements

version 0.9.0
date: 01-07-2013
  * introduced Spring framework! services are still based on a wrapper from spring to the old modality
  * improved mirror-caching: now even the downloader for the mirror supports full content-negotiation
  * bug fixing on the SKOS UI
  * re-engineered the build scripts. Now the xpi contains only client code for firefox. The target folder
    now hosts the client code (same as xpi, but before being xpized), the server distribution (folder "server"),
    and a "embedded" folder (currently not working) which contains the code of the old firefox extension + 
    java server. 

version 0.8.6

  * fixed bug in search preventing use of space separated keywords 
  * improved version number management, by reusing the same vn defined in the core ST for updating the
    previous one 
  * import is more robust when the passed URI is wrong for the ontology but it is a successful URL for
    retrieving its data (see issue 63)
  * added facility methods in XMLHelp class which simplify unit testing over XML responses

version 0.8.0
date: 10-10-2011

    main-project if it is not present (that is, if the main-project comes from an earlier version of
    SemanticTurkey)
  * added support for SKOS / SKOS-XL
  * removed constraint on "at least a type (not owl:Thing) for each resource", now owl:Thing is always visible

  * improved Mac compatibility (still considered unstable)
  * improved assignment of values from properties, by inferring proper range type from both type of the range 
    and of the property itself
  * support for content negotation (now import functionality always asks for proper RDF format, by inferring
    it from the file extension, default is RDF/XML)

version 0.7.1

  * created a new class: UpdateRoutines.java for hosting procedures for restoring integrity of folder
    SemanticTurkeyData coming from older installations of Semantic Turkey
  * fixed a missing case (when a new prefix-ns pair overwrites a previous prefix mapping) in which the user
    is prevented from changing mappings for prefixes owl, rdf, rdfs (and added the
  * weblinks are now visible on the editor panel - fixed bug on unreadable datatype property values populated
    with URLs (they should be active links opening the url in the browser) - forbidden change of owl, rdf and
    rdfs prefixes (this is required as some part of the UI code is currently using wired static strings
    prefixed qnames) - now when a rdf:Property is valued, it does not ask anymore: "do you want to add
    'undefined' as a value for property?" but writes 'new value' instead of 'undefined'. Th
  * cleaning of SemTurkeyHTTP.jsm and other legacy code - bug fixes and enhancements in editor panel
  * removed old useless UI files - cleaned code to avoid warning produced by Mozilla extension tester
  * fixed bug in adding values for datatype properties through annotation/drag'n'drop action

version 0.7
date: 08-02-2008
  * major release with lot of new features and strong modification of the whole system
  * Main System:
    * Project-based ontology management. Now users can run ST in the traditional single-project continuous-editing
      of previous versions, or open specific new projects and decide if they need to be saved each time, or if
      they just are edited in real-time
    * java packages are now exported to OSGi according to three different export-list files: 1) inside the
      felix jar, which contains javax.* packages to be exported specifically tailored for the version of the
      run-time Java VM; 2) a file inside semantic-turkey jar, exporting packages used by Semantic Turkey
      which need to be provided at the hand of extension developers 3) a further external file which can be
      used by extension developers to add new libraries which may be required by their extension
    * SPARQL Panel
  * Firefox Layer: almost completely rewritten, in light of a more mature support for extensions.
    It now features:
    * cleaner and "starting-to-be-documented" code :-)
    * exploitation of modules support introduced with Firefox 3.0
    * "http transparent" API based on the same "service" structure of the service layer
    * events mechanism for triple-level and higher-level actions
    * set compatibility to FireFox 3.5 (beware, as for all FF3.5 extensions, this won't be back-compatible
      with previous versions of Firefox)
  * Service Layer:
    * uses new OWL Art API (see Persistence Layer)
  * Persistence:
    * new OWL Art API. Bundled with ST there is now a Sesame2 implementation of these API.
    * dedicated ...
  * Support for testing:
    * a purely command line client-server java version of Semantic Turkey can be run in two modes:
      * direct mode: you can test immediately any code modification you do/extension you add from the compiled
        classes in your development environment
      * http mode: this mode allows the developer to completely recreate the same environment of a built xpi
        so services and persistence components are loaded from felix environment (and thus need to be bundled
        as a felix service bundle) and all communication is handled through http with a running instance of
        Semantic Turkey
      * code for the two kind of testing is the same, as everything is modeled according to a common testing
        interface
  * added import of package "org.osgi.util.tracker" in PluginManager for OSGi
  * ISSUES:
    * this version is compatible only with older java plugin (needs for "enable new java plugin" checkbox
      to be disabled in the Java Control Panel), but has been tested extensively with different java versions

version 0.6.7
date: 12-03-2009
  * deregistration mechanism for Semantic Turkey Annotation Extension
  * bugfix in url escaping when taking bookmarks

version 0.6.6
date: 09-03-2009
  * set an extension point in the javascript-FireFox side for registering different annotation services. They
    can then be switched through the options menu. The default one is defAnnot. RangeAnnotator extension now
    provides the xpointer annotation function.
  * modified build file to include the defaults directory from UI project into the xpi
  * UI modifications:
    * web page links now opened in new tab and not in a new FF window
    * fixed a bug in create subproperty
    * added support for changing the supported languages for annotation properties 
    * added a dedicated error message (linking to an help page in the official site) when mozilla-java bridge
      fails to initialize
