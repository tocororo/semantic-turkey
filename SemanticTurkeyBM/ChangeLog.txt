version 0.7.2 (SNAPSHOT)

  * modified getSubClasses request from Cls.java for showing chosen labels instead of the class qname
  * fixed a BUG in the response packaging in the server to always reply with properly UTF-8 encoded characters
  * fixed BUG in SPARQL panel (on client, UI project) preventing language tagged property values to be shown (javscript null pointer exception)
  * added a new updateRoutine (see UpdateRoutines in resources package) for specifying the ModelType of main-project
    if it is not present (that is, if the main-project comes from an earlier version of SemanticTurkey)

version 0.7.1

  * created a new class: UpdateRoutines.java for hosting procedures for restoring integrity of folder
    SemanticTurkeyData coming from older installations of Semantic Turkey
  * fixed a missing case (when a new prefix-ns pair overwrites a previous prefix mapping) in which the user
    is prevented from changing mappings for prefixes owl, rdf, rdfs (and added the
  * weblinks are now visible on the editor panel - fixed bug on unreadable datatype property values populated
    with URLs (they should be active links opening the url in the browser) - forbidden change of owl, rdf and
    rdfs prefixes (this is required as some part of the UI code is currently using wired static strings
    prefixed qnames) - now when a rdf:Property is valued, it does not ask anymore: "do you want to add 'undefined' as a value for property?" but writes 'new value' instead of 'undefined'. Th
  * cleaning of SemTurkeyHTTP.jsm and other legacy code - bug fixes and enhancements in editor panel
  * removed old useless UI files - cleaned code to avoid warning produced by Mozilla extension tester
  * fixed bug in adding values for datatype properties through annotation/drag'n'drop action

version 0.7
date: 08-02-2008
  * major release with lot of new features and strong modification of the whole system
  * Main System:
    * Project-based ontology management. Now users can run ST in the traditional single-project continuous-editing
      of previous versions, or open specific new projects and decide if they need to be saved each time, or if
      they just are edited in real-time
    * java packages are now exported to OSGi according to three different export-list files: 1) inside the
      felix jar, which contains javax.* packages to be exported specifically tailored for the version of the
      run-time Java VM; 2) a file inside semantic-turkey jar, exporting packages used by Semantic Turkey
      which need to be provided at the hand of extension developers 3) a further external file which can be
      used by extension developers to add new libraries which may be required by their extension
    * SPARQL Panel
  * Firefox Layer: almost completely rewritten, in light of a more mature support for extensions.
    It now features:
    * cleaner and "starting-to-be-documented" code :-)
    * exploitation of modules support introduced with Firefox 3.0
    * "http transparent" API based on the same "service" structure of the service layer
    * events mechanism for triple-level and higher-level actions
    * set compatibility to FireFox 3.5 (beware, as for all FF3.5 extensions, this won't be back-compatible with 
      previous versions of Firefox)
  * Service Layer:
    * uses new OWL Art API (see Persistence Layer)
  * Persistence:
    * new OWL Art API. Bundled with ST there is now a Sesame2 implementation of these API.
    * dedicated ...
  * Support for testing:
    * a purely command line client-server java version of Semantic Turkey can be run in two modes:
      * direct mode: you can test immediately any code modification you do/extension you add from the compiled
        classes in your development environment
      * http mode: this mode allows the developer to completely recreate the same environment of a built xpi
        so services and persistence components are loaded from felix environment (and thus need to be bundled
        as a felix service bundle) and all communication is handled through http with a running instance of
        Semantic Turkey
      * code for the two kind of testing is the same, as everything is modeled according to a common testing
        interface
  * added import of package "org.osgi.util.tracker" in PluginManager for OSGi
  * ISSUES:
    * this version is compatible only with older java plugin (needs for "enable new java plugin" checkbox
      to be disabled in the Java Control Panel), but has been tested extensively with different java versions

date: 12-03-2009

version 0.6.6
date: 09-03-2009
  * set an extension point in the javascript-FireFox side for registering different annotation services. They can then be switched
    through the options menu. The default one is defAnnot. RangeAnnotator extension now provides the xpointer annotation function.
  * modified build file to include the defaults directory from UI project into the xpi
  * UI modifications:
    * web page links now opened in new tab and not in a new FF window
    * fixed a bug in create subproperty
    * added support for changing the supported languages for annotation properties 
    * added a dedicated error message (linking to an help page in the official site) when mozilla-java bridge fails to initialize

  * Submission of source code to the project site on: http://code.google.com/p/semanticturkey/
