# This file will contain basic install information to properly run the ST server, which cannot be stored in
# the sturkey.properties file

# at the moment, it only contains the path to the ST data folder, which is mandatory to be setup in advance,
# as the sturkey.properties file, containing all major system configuration preferences, is then located in
# that directory

# note that the value of the "data.dir" property must be either a non existing directory, which will be
# created and initialized with Semantic Turkey data information, or an existing directory *only* if it has
# been initialized by Semantic Turkey (i.e. do not choose an existing directory with no ST data).
